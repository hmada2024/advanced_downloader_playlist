# Advanced Spider Fetch

Advanced Spider Fetch is a user-friendly Windows desktop application built with Python. It provides a graphical interface (GUI) for the powerful command-line tool **yt-dlp**, making it easy to download videos and playlists from YouTube and many other websites supported by yt-dlp.

The main goal is to simplify the download process, manage multiple downloads effectively through a queue, and keep track of your download history.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Intuitive GUI:** A clean interface powered by CustomTkinter, eliminating the need for complex command-line arguments.
*   **Versatile Downloading:** Download single videos or entire playlists.
*   **Format Selection:** Choose your preferred video quality (e.g., up to 1080p, 720p) or download audio-only as MP3.
*   **Playlist Control:** Select specific items from a playlist to download.
*   **Download Queue:** Add multiple download tasks to a queue. Downloads run sequentially (one after another) to manage resources efficiently. Monitor the status and progress of each task.
*   **Task Management:** Cancel individual tasks in the queue (pending or running). Clear finished tasks from the queue view.
*   **History:** Keep track of your completed downloads and fetched info for easy reuse or reference.
*   **Clean Output:** Downloads are processed in a temporary folder (`ASF_TEMP` in your user home directory), keeping your final save location tidy. Only the final file is moved.
*   **Convenient Paste:** Quickly paste URLs from your clipboard using the "Paste" button.
*   **Bundled FFmpeg:** Comes with the necessary FFmpeg components for media processing.
